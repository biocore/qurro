Qurro visualizes the output from a tool like
[songbird](https://github.com/biocore/songbird) or
[DEICODE](https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE). It displays a plot of
__feature rankings__ (either the differentials produced by a tool like
songbird, or the loadings in a compositional biplot produced by a tool
like DEICODE) alongside a plot showing the __log ratios__ of
selected features' abundances within samples.

Qurro can be used standalone (as a Python 3 script that generates a
folder containing a HTML/JS/CSS visualization) or as a
[QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/) plugin (that generates a QZV file that can be
visualized at [view.qiime2.org](https://view.qiime2.org/) or by using
`qiime tools view`).

Qurro should work with most modern web browsers. Firefox or Chrome are
recommended.

Qurro is still being developed, so backwards-incompatible changes might
occur. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the development team at
[mfedarko@ucsd.edu](mailto:mfedarko@ucsd.edu).

## Demos

See the <a href="https://biocore.github.io/qurro">Qurro website</a> for a list of
interactive demos using real datasets.

This visualization (which uses data from
[this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315489/), with ranks
generated by [songbird](https://github.com/biocore/songbird/)) can be viewed
online [here](https://biocore.github.io/qurro/demos/red_sea/index.html).

## Installation and Usage

You can install Qurro using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```
pip install numpy
pip install qurro
```

A python version of at least 3.5 is required to use Qurro.

### Temporary Caveat

Certain characters in column names in the the sample metadata, feature metadata, and feature differentials (if passed) will be replaced with similar characters:

| Old Character(s) | New Character |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `.`  | `:`  |
| `]`  | `)`  |
| `[`  | `(`  |
| `'`, `"`, or `\ `  | <code>\|</code>  |

This is due to some downstream issues with handling these sorts of characters
in field names. See [this issue](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/issues/66)
for context.

### Integration with metabolomics feature metadata

If you have a GNPS feature metadata file (where each row in the file has a
`parent mass` and `RTConsensus` column), you can pass in the `-gnps`
(`--assume-gnps-feature-metadata`) command-line argument to Qurro's
standalone script to make Qurro understand the metadata file. **Please
note that this functionality is experimental**; furthermore, it is not yet
available in the QIIME 2 plugin version of Qurro.

### Tutorials

Examples of using Qurro (both inside and outside of QIIME 2) are
available in Qurro's example Jupyter notebooks, which are located
[here](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/tree/master/example_notebooks):
- [**`deicode_example.ipynb`**](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/blob/master/example_notebooks/DEICODE_sleep_apnea/deicode_example.ipynb)
  demonstrates using [DEICODE](https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE) and then using Qurro to visualize DEICODE's output.
- [**`songbird_example.ipynb`**](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/blob/master/example_notebooks/songbird_red_sea/songbird_example.ipynb)
  demonstrates using [songbird](https://github.com/biocore/songbird) and then using Qurro to visualize songbird's output.

### Interacting with a Qurro visualization
The two plots (one of feature rankings, and one of samples' log ratios)
in a Qurro visualization are linked [1]: when a change is made to the
selected features in a log ratio, both the rank plot and sample plot are
accordingly modified.

To elaborate on that: clicking on two features in the rank plot sets a new
numerator feature (determined from the first-clicked feature) and a
new denominator feature (determined from the second-clicked feature) for the
abundance log ratios in the sample plot.

You can also run textual queries over the various feature IDs in order to
construct more complicated log ratios (e.g. "the log ratio of the combined
abundances of all features that contain the text 'X' over the combined
abundances of all features that contain the text 'Y'").
Although this method doesn't require you to manually select features on the
rank plot, the rank plot is still updated to indicate the features used in the
log ratios.

## Citing Qurro

A manuscript describing Qurro is in preparation. In the meantime, you can cite
the DOI of Qurro's source code (provided by Zenodo). See
[this link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3257763) for citation instructions.

### Dependencies

Code files for the following projects are distributed within
`qurro/support_file/vendor/`.

    "license." In any case, thank you to [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/eric/)
    for providing this resource!

The following software projects are required for Qurro's python code
to function, although they are not distributed with Qurro (and are
instead installed alongside Qurro).
- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)
- [biom-format](http://biom-format.org/)
- [click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/)

### Testing Dependencies

For python testing/style checking, Qurro uses
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/),
[pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov),
[flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), and
[black](https://github.com/ambv/black). You'll also need to have QIIME 2
installed to run most of the python tests (the exact QIIME 2 version shouldn't
matter too much).

For JavaScript testing/style checking, Qurro uses
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/),
[mocha-headless-chrome](https://github.com/direct-adv-interfaces/mocha-headless-chrome),
[nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc), [jshint](https://jshint.com/),
and [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Qurro also uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and
[Codecov](https://codecov.io/).

### Data Sources

The test data located in `qurro/tests/input/byrd/` are from
[this repository](https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/reference-frames).
These data, in turn, originate from Byrd et al.'s 2017 study on atopic
dermatitis [2].

The test data located in `qurro/tests/input/sleep_apnea/`
(and in `example_notebooks/DEICODE_sleep_apnea/input/`)
are from [this Qiita study](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/10422),
which is associated with Tripathi et al.'s 2018 study on sleep apnea [4].

The test data located in `qurro/tests/input/moving_pictures/`
are from [the QIIME 2 moving pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/tutorials/moving-pictures/).
The `ordination.qza` file in this folder was computed based on the
[DEICODE moving pictures tutorial](https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/deicode/19/).
These data (sans the DEICODE ordination) are associated with Caporaso et al. 2011 [5].

Lastly, the data located in `qurro/tests/input/red_sea`
(and in `example_notebooks/songbird_red_sea/input/`, and shown in the
screenshot above) were taken from songbird's GitHub repository in its
[`data/redsea/`](https://github.com/biocore/songbird/tree/master/data/redsea)
folder, and are associated with
[this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315489/) [3].

### Logo

Qurro's logo was created using the [Lalezar](https://github.com/BornaIz/Lalezar) font.
Also, shout out to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/DavidWells/7d2e0e1bc78f4ac59a123ddf8b74932d) for showing how to center images in GitHub markdown files (which is more of a hassle than it sounds).

### Special Thanks

The design of Qurro was strongly inspired by
[EMPeror](https://github.com/biocore/emperor) and
[q2-emperor](https://github.com/qiime2/q2-emperor/), along with
[DEICODE](https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE). A big shoutout to
Yoshiki Vázquez-Baeza for his help in planning this project, as well as to
Cameron Martino for a ton of work on getting the code in a distributable state
(and making it work with QIIME 2). Thanks also to Jamie Morton, who wrote the
original code for producing rank and sample plots from which this is derived.

And thanks to a bunch of the Knight Lab for helping name the tool :)
