### What does this tool do?
(mostly taken from our paper abstract/intro.)

Lots of tools for analyzing " 'omic" datasets can produce
__feature rankings__. Regardless of if they're *differentials* (corresponding
to the log-fold change in relative abundance re: a covariate) produced by a
tool like [Songbird](https://github.com/biocore/songbird/),
[ALDEx2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ALDEx2.html),
etc., or the *feature loadings* in a (compositional)
biplot produced by a tool like [DEICODE](https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE),
either of these input types can be sorted numerically to
"rank" features based on their association with some sort of variation in your
dataset.

A common use of these rankings is examining the __log-ratios__ of
particularly high- or low-ranked features across the samples in your dataset,
and seeing how these log-ratios relate to your sample metadata (e.g. "does
this log-ratio differ between 'healthy' and 'sick' samples?"). For more
details (why rankings, why log-ratios, ...), check out
[this open access paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10656-5).

__Qurro is an interactive web application for visualizing feature rankings
and log-ratios.__ It does this
using a two-plot interface: on the left of the screen, a "rank plot" shows
how features are ranked for a selected ranking, and on the right of the screen
a "sample plot" shows the log-ratios of selected features' abundances within
samples. There are a variety of controls available for selecting features for
a log-ratio, and changing the selected log-ratio updates both the rank plot
(highlighting selected features) and the sample plot (changing the y-axis
value of each sample to match the selected log-ratio).

### How do I use it?

Qurro can be used standalone (as a Python 3 script that generates a
folder containing a HTML/JS/CSS visualization) or as a
[QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/) plugin (that generates a QZV file that can be
visualized at [view.qiime2.org](https://view.qiime2.org/) or by using
`qiime tools view`). *Starting with Qurro v0.3.0, Qurro requires a QIIME 2
version of at least 2019.7.*

Qurro should work with most modern web browsers. Firefox or Chrome are
recommended.

Qurro is still being developed, so backwards-incompatible changes might
occur. If you have any bug reports, feature requests, questions, or if you just
want to yell at me, then feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/issues) in this repository!

## Demos

See the <a href="https://biocore.github.io/qurro">Qurro website</a> for a list of
interactive demos using real datasets.

### Screenshot: Visualizing KEGG orthologs in metagenomic data from the Red Sea

<img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocore/qurro/master/screenshots/redsea_data.png" alt="Screenshot showing a Qurro visualization of ranked features (which in this dataset correspond to KEGG orthologs) and a scatterplot plot of the log ratio of certain features' abundances in samples." />

This visualization (which uses data from
[this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315489/), with
differentials generated by [Songbird](https://github.com/biocore/songbird/))
can be viewed online [here](https://biocore.github.io/qurro/demos/red_sea/index.html).

## Installation and Usage

You can install Qurro using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```
pip install numpy
pip install qurro
```

A python version of at least 3.5 is required to use Qurro.

### Temporary Caveat

Certain characters in column names in the sample metadata, feature metadata (if passed), and feature differentials (if passed) will be replaced with similar characters or just removed entirely:

| Old Character(s) | New Character |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `.`  | `:`  |
| `]`  | `)`  |
| `[`  | `(`  |
| `\ ` | <code>\|</code>  |
| `'` or `"` | Nothing |

This is due to some downstream issues with handling these sorts of characters
in field names. See [this issue](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/issues/66)
for context.

## Tutorials

### "Moving Pictures" Tutorial

In the style of the QIIME 2 and DEICODE moving pictures tutorials, there is a
draft moving pictures tutorial (showing how to use Qurro within QIIME 2, and
how to interact with the generated Qurro visualization) **available
[here](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/blob/master/docs/tutorials/moving-pictures/moving-pictures.md).**
This tutorial is still a work in progress, so feel free to contact us if you
have any outstanding questions (or any suggestions for improving this
tutorial).

### Running Qurro from the command line

Examples of using Qurro (both inside and outside of QIIME 2) are
available in Qurro's example Jupyter notebooks, which are located
[here](https://github.com/biocore/qurro/tree/master/example_notebooks):
- [**`deicode_example.ipynb`**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/biocore/qurro/blob/master/example_notebooks/DEICODE_sleep_apnea/deicode_example.ipynb)
  demonstrates using [DEICODE](https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE) and then using Qurro to visualize DEICODE's output.
- [**`songbird_example.ipynb`**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/biocore/qurro/blob/master/example_notebooks/songbird_red_sea/songbird_example.ipynb)
  demonstrates using [Songbird](https://github.com/biocore/songbird) and then using Qurro to visualize Songbird's output.

## Qarcoal
**Qarcoal** (pronounced "charcoal") is a new part of Qurro that lets you
compute log-ratios based on taxonomic searching directly from the command-line.
This can be useful for a variety of reasons.

Currently, Qarcoal is only available through Qurro's QIIME 2 plugin interface.
Please see [**`qarcoal_example.ipynb`**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/biocore/qurro/blob/master/example_notebooks/qarcoal/qarcoal_example.ipynb)
for a demonstration of using Qarcoal.

## Poster
We presented [this poster](https://biocore.github.io/qurro/CRISP-poster.pdf) on Qurro at the
[2019 CRISP Annual Review](https://crisp.engineering.virginia.edu/2019-crisp-annual-review).
The data shown here is already slightly outdated compared to the actual Qurro paper (e.g. the differentials are slightly different), but feel free to check out the poster anyway!

## Citing Qurro

A manuscript describing Qurro is in preparation. In the meantime, you can cite
the DOI of Qurro's source code (provided by Zenodo). See
[this link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3257763) for citation instructions.

### Testing Dependencies

For python testing/style checking, Qurro uses
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/),
[pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov),
[flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), and
[black](https://github.com/ambv/black). You'll also need to have QIIME 2
installed to run most of the python tests (your QIIME 2 version should be at
least 2019.7, due to the `FeatureData[Differential]` type being merged into
q2-types starting with this release).

For JavaScript testing/style checking, Qurro uses
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/),
[mocha-headless-chrome](https://github.com/direct-adv-interfaces/mocha-headless-chrome),
[nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc), [jshint](https://jshint.com/),
and [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Qurro also uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and
[Codecov](https://codecov.io/).

The Jupyter notebooks in Qurro's `example_notebooks/` folder are automatically
rerun using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
also.

### Data Sources

The test data located in `qurro/tests/input/mackerel/` were exported from
QIIME 2 artifacts in [this repository](https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/qurro-mackerel-analysis). These data are from Minich et al. 2019 [1].

The test data located in `qurro/tests/input/byrd/` are from
[this repository](https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/reference-frames).
These data, in turn, originate from Byrd et al.'s 2017 study on atopic
dermatitis [2].

The test data located in `qurro/tests/input/sleep_apnea/`
(and in `example_notebooks/DEICODE_sleep_apnea/input/`)
are from [this Qiita study](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/10422),
which is associated with Tripathi et al.'s 2018 study on sleep apnea [4].

The test data located in `qurro/tests/input/moving_pictures/`
are from [the QIIME 2 moving pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/tutorials/moving-pictures/).
The `ordination.qza` file in this folder was computed based on the
[DEICODE moving pictures tutorial](https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/deicode/19/).
These data (sans the DEICODE ordination) are associated with Caporaso et al. 2011 [5].

Lastly, the data located in `qurro/tests/input/red_sea`
(and in `example_notebooks/songbird_red_sea/input/`, and shown in the
screenshot above) were taken from Songbird's GitHub repository in its
[`data/redsea/`](https://github.com/biocore/songbird/tree/master/data/redsea)
folder, and are associated with Thompson et al. 2017 [3].

### Logo

Qurro's logo was created using the [Lalezar](https://github.com/BornaIz/Lalezar) font.
Also, shout out to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/DavidWells/7d2e0e1bc78f4ac59a123ddf8b74932d) for showing how to center images in GitHub markdown files (which is more of a hassle than it sounds).

### Special Thanks

The design of Qurro was strongly inspired by
[EMPeror](https://github.com/biocore/emperor) and
[q2-emperor](https://github.com/qiime2/q2-emperor/), along with
[DEICODE](https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE). A big shoutout to
Yoshiki Vázquez-Baeza for his help in planning this project, as well as to
Cameron Martino for a ton of work on getting the code in a distributable state
(and making it work with QIIME 2). Thanks also to Jamie Morton, who wrote the
original code for producing rank and sample plots from which this is derived.

And thanks to a bunch of the Knight Lab for helping name the tool :)
