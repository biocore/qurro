       in pandas). I guess we could also ostensibly use these lines' types here
       eventually, but for now we just skip them.

       Notes:
        -The line numbers are 0-indexed (so they can easily be thrown in to
         pandas.read_csv() as the skiprows parameter)
        -This doesn't check check the first line of the file (assumed to be the
         header)
        -This stops checking lines once it gets to the first non-header line
         that doesn't start with "#q2:". Currently, "#q2:types" is the only Q2
         "comment directive" available, but ostensibly this could detect future
         Q2 comment directives.
        -This checks if md_file_loc is of type StringIO. If so, this will
         handle it properly (iterating over it directly); otherwise, this
         assumes that md_file_loc is an actual filename, and this will open
         it using open().
